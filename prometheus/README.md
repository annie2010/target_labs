# Prometheus Hangman Lab...

## <img src="../assets/lab.png" width="auto" height="32"/> Your Mission

> We're going to play a hangman game Prometheus Style!
> The game consists of a hangman service and a CLI to submit guesses. The hangman
> service queries a given dictionary to get a list of words for the guess
> word. To play the game, we are going to leverage Prometheus metrics to
> track good/bad guess counts as well as tracking a tally of the win/loose rates.
> Sounds cool?

1. Clone the [Labs Repo](https://github.com/gopherland/labs2)
2. Cd prometheus
3. Instrument the hangman code base and add 2 prometheus metrics to track your
   good and bad guesses (see metrics.go and game.go).
4. Next define a prometheus gauge to track your game results:
   ie +1 for wins and -1 for loss (see metrics.go and tally.go)
5. Install prometheus (see lab template README.md)
6. Configure the scraper to scrape your hangman service on a given port.
7. Start your hangman service
8. Run the provided hangman CLI (cmd/cli/main.go)
9. You can now enjoy the fruits of your labor and try out your guessing skills while watching your game performance in the Prometheus dashboard...

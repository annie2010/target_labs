# GraphQL Lab

## <img src="../assets/lab.png" width="auto" height="32"/> Your Mission

> Barnes And Noble wants to be part of the cool kids crew and wants to
> surface there large library of books as a graphql API so they can integrate
> with other vendors. You've been tasked to develop a graphQL server for them.

> The service needs should surface the following functionality:
>  * list all books
>  * list all authors
>  * list all books by author
>  * create a new author
>  * delete an author by ISAN
>  * delete a book by ISBN

1. Implement your service using [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen)
2. Define your GraphQL schema to support the required queries and mutations
3. Using GraphIQL ensure your service is providing the correct functionality by insuing queries and mutations

## Commands
